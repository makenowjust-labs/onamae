# Onamae üìõ

> Ordered nominal sets implementation written in Scala, a port of the [ons-hs](https://github.com/Jaxan/ons-hs) library.

"Namae (ÂêçÂâç)" is a Japanese word that means "name" and the prefix "O („Åä)" is for honorifics.
So, "Onamae („ÅäÂêçÂâç)" is a honorifics form of "name".
However, here's "**O**" does also mean the abbreviation of "**O**rdered".

## What is this?

This library provides an implementation of ordered nominal sets in the way described in [Venhoek, et al. (2022)], "Fast Computations on Ordered Nominal Sets".
Furthermore, this is a port of Haskell's [ons-hs](https://github.com/Jaxan/ons-hs) library.
